I﻿ am a first-year PhD student at the University of Oxford studying reinforcement learning in open-ended settings with additional interests in evolutionary algorithms and artificial life systems. I am supervised by [Dr. Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com/) as part of [FLAIR](https://foersterlab.com/).

I completed my MSc in Machine Learning at University College London, where I worked on transfer learning in RL at [UCL DARK Lab](https://ucldark.com/) under the supervision of [Prof. Tim Rocktäschel](https://rockt.github.io/) and [Prof. Edward Grefenstette](https://www.egrefen.com/). Before this, I obtained my BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.

B﻿efore starting my PhD I worked for 2 years as a Machine Learning Researcher on the RL team at [VivaCity](https://vivacitylabs.com/technology/junction-control/), where I worked on using RL for traffic control.
I﻿ have previously completed software engineering internships at [G-Research](https://www.gresearch.co.uk/) and [PlayFusion](https://playfusion.com/), where I worked on internal trading software and RL for video games respectively.
