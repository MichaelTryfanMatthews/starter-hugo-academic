I﻿ am a Machine Learning Researcher on the Reinforcement Learning team at VivaCity, where I work on using RL for traffic control.

I completed my MSc in Machine Learning at UCL, where I worked on integrating prior knowledge of policies into downstream tasks in RL.  Before this, I got my BA in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge.

I﻿ have previously completed software engineering internships at G-Research and PlayFusion.
